### Missing Women: New Evidence from YT Videos

Following <a href = "https://github.com/geosensing/women-count">work</a> that measures missing women in public places in India, we count the proportion of women at food stalls (+ roads) in YT videos in India and elsewhere. 

Plausible interpretations: The proportion of women that we see may be biased because of biases in what YouTubers shoot where and when. It is also plausible that differences are founded in how many women work outside their homes (especially in city centers). The differences could also be founded in different tastes with women preferring to eat inside (by getting food delivered home), etc.
